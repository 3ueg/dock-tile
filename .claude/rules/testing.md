## Regression-Guard Convention

The recurring regressions came from critical invariants buried in `@MainActor` singletons
touching real CFPreferences/FileManager — untestable, so unguarded. When a regression-prone
**decision** lives in a singleton/view, extract the rule into a `nonisolated static func` (or
plain `static` on an already-`@MainActor` type) taking plain values, delegate the call site to
it, and unit-test the seam so a broken rule fails loudly. Existing seams: `resolveDockVisibility`,
`IconStyle.from(…isDarkMode:)` / `.resolve(…isDarkMode:)` (unrecognised value → nil = don't act, never Default; the observed macOS value set is guarded by `IconStyleResolveTests`),
`HelperBundleManager.iconMatchesStyle` (launch self-heal: live icon vs the resolved style's variant, byte-compared; unanswerable → match — guarded by `HelperIconMatchTests`),
`shouldReregisterOnLaunch`, `classifyForMigration`,
`runRegenerationBatch`, `helperInfoPlist` / `stripMainAppIcons`, `Debouncer`,
`AppInstallChecker.classifyInstallStatus`, `PopoverMetrics` / `PopoverSettings.resolve`,
`SmartAddEngine.rankGroups` (app + identity de-dup — no two cards share a name/icon) / `.score` / `.coLaunchClusters` / `.dominantCategory` (nil without signal, never a silent `.productivity`) / `SmartAddCategory.identity` + `Identity.coLaunch` backstop,
`AnalyticsService.resolveConsent` / `.shouldCollect`,
`DockTileDetailView.resolveDockAction` / `.dockActionIsEnabled` / `.contentSignature`,
`HelperBundleManager.shouldPerformDockRemoval` / `.helperFolderName` (same-name tiles disambiguate to distinct folders) / `.dockFileLabel` (Dock tooltip = display name, never the folder stem) / `.helperIconsComplete` (bundle icon-integrity probe), `HelperMigrationManager.classifyHelperHealth` (self-heal targets pinned-and-broken bundles only — drafts safe), `DiagnosticsLog.shouldRecord` (verbose dev/prod gate),
`ConfigurationManager.canCreateNewTile` (sidebar + gate — never deadlock at zero tiles),
`IconDepthMetrics` (glyph size-ratio cap + glass stroke + Liquid-Glass surface/glyph sheen + shadow + shading, per style, size-gated — shared by the baked `.icns` renderer and the live preview; `glyphSheen` covers symbols 0.55 and emoji 0.18),
`ToneMap.fit` / `.contrastRatio` + `TilePalette.resolve` (+ `fillWasDeepened`) (every tile colour role derived with every drawn pair >= 3:1 — the Dark-glyph `#5F00FF` visibility case lives here; replaced `liftedForDarkGlyph`), `CustomiseTileView.colourRowState`, `DockTileIconPreview.displayStyle` (canonical forced previews), `HelperBundleManager.declarativeFillsP3`, + `TintColor.colors`/`.nsColors(for:iconType:background:)` (Dark splits SF Symbol vs emoji, guarded by `DarkGlyphTreatmentTests`) + `.badgeColors(for:tint:)` (Settings-badge mirror, lock-step guarded by `BadgeColorMappingTests`),
`AppRelocation.classify` / `.blocksBundleGeneration` / `.requiresRelocation` (translocation → move-to-/Applications decision),
`FloatingPanel.resolveAnchor` / `DockPrefs.resolve` (popover pin point — magnification `largesize+25` envelope, autohide tilesize fallback, orientation from pref; guarded by `FloatingPanelAnchorTests`),
`HelperAppDelegate.shouldSwallowReopen` (post-cold-launch reopen swallow is time-bounded ~1s — an unbounded flag silently ate the next Dock click when macOS skipped the trailing reopen, issue #12; guarded by `HelperReopenSwallowTests`. The ⌘Tab use of it (issue #15) is delegate wiring no unit test reaches — verify with the `NSWorkspace.openApplication` replay in architecture.md),
`FloatingPanel.keyboardAnchorPoint` (⌘Tab popover anchors at the last Dock click while its screen is connected, else the centre of the screen passed in — the primary screen at the call site — never the mouse; issue #15, guarded by `FloatingPanelKeyboardAnchorTests`),
`PaneScrollEdgeEffect.opacity(forOffset:)` (title-band scroll scrim ramp — 0 at rest AND during rubber-band overscroll so the chromeless v2 band stays chromeless, 1 past the ramp, linear between; guarded by `PaneScrollEdgeEffectTests`),
`AppListEditor.removing(_:from:)` / `.moving(_:onto:in:)` (tile editor's remove/reorder reducer, guarded by `AppListEditorTests`),
`PopoverPreviewCanvas.fitScale` (hero zoom that scales the fixed-size real popover into a `.worstCase` frame, guarded by `PopoverPreviewCanvasTests`),
`PopoverPanelLayout.gridPanelSize` / `.listPanelSize` (the panel size formulas shared by the real panels and the editor canvas — the list pins only its width, so an undershoot here CLIPS the panel; the grid's `includesMissingCaption` bills the editor-only "Not installed" line),
`PopoverPreviewCanvas.naturalPanelSize` / `.naturalScale` (the `.natural` fit — the panel's intrinsic size and the scale that fits it into the fixed-width detail column),
`ConfigurationManager.displayName(for:)` / `.commitDisplayName` (the sidebar/title-band name lags the stored one until an explicit commit — seeded on load, or the mechanism is silently inert),
`SmartAddEngine.suggestionsForAddFlow` (filters what an opened add dialog shows; since 2026-09-02 the dialog only opens while Smart Add is on — off creates a blank tile directly),
`IconStyleManager.displayPollAction` (main-app icon-style display poll runs only while the app is visible — never restarted while running, never left running hidden; issue #22, guarded by `IconStyleDisplayPollTests`),
`TileFace.showsSystemIcon` + `DockTileConfiguration.iconSignature` (Tinted and Clear tile faces show the system's render only when the helper's `DTIconSignature` matches the tile's current look — stale/unstamped/other styles draw our own; every icon field moves the signature, non-icon fields don't; issue #22, guarded by `TileFaceTests`),
`ConfigurationDefaults.iconValue` (new tiles default to the `"plus"` placeholder glyph, not a category icon),
`DockTileConfiguration.duplicate(named:)` (a duplicate keeps every content field; only id/name/bundle id/Dock bookkeeping reset — compared through the encoded JSON, issue #21; guarded by `DockTileDuplicateTests`),
`PopoverItemMenu.targetPath` / `.entries` / `.dismissesPopover` / `.runningMatchIndex` / `.claimsEvent` (popover item context menu — missing → no target → no menu, apps target the copy `AppLauncher` launches (lastKnownPath first), apps never get a bundle hand-off item (App Management alert), folders never get running rows, hidden app → no Hide, running match by bundle path not id, overlay claims only right-/Control-clicks so left-click launch and scrolling stay SwiftUI's; guarded by `PopoverItemMenuTests`),
`AppsFaceGrid.columns` / `.cells` / `.drawBox` / `.miniShadow` / `.fillGrays` / `.desaturatesMinis` / `.select` (Apps face: one centred 0.60 icon for 1 → 2×2 for 2–4 → 3×3 from 5, folders fitted to the cell, missing skipped, nine max; guarded by `AppsFaceGridTests` + `AppsFaceRenderTests` + `AppsFacePreviewTests`),
`IconDocumentBuilder.appsFaceIconJSON` (system fills + explicit flat keys + one grid per appearance slot, glyph documents never gain a tinted hiding; `IconDocumentBuilderTests`, compiled end-to-end in `IconCompilerTests`, which also asserts each appearance stack shows only its own grid),
`AppIconStyleRenderer.descriptorValues` / `.render` + `HelperBundleManager.styledAppsFaceMinis` (App Grid minis rendered in a NAMED style via private IconServices — Default/Dark/Clear Dark differ by luminance, same icon-grid margin as the public render, folders keep the public icon; `AppIconStyleRendererTests`, which fail rather than skip on macOS 26+ when a render is nil),
`AppInstallChecker.isInstalled` (the one installed-predicate shared by the Apps-face bake, the preview and the Customise Apps card),
`CustomiseTileView.TileStyle(face:iconType:)` / `.applyStyle` / `.inspectorSections` / `.appsSummary(items:isInstalled:)` (the Style picker and the Apps card; `applyStyle` saves the outgoing symbol/emoji + size + Colour/Mono background + tile colour into `savedSymbol` / `savedEmoji` (schema v11) and restores the incoming one, so switching cards never loses a choice; `CustomiseStyleTests` + `SavedGlyphTests`, English host),
`DockTileDetailView.dockActionParameters` (`tile_added_to_dock` / `tile_updated` parameters incl. `face`; `DockActionResolutionTests`),
`AppDelegate.clampedWindowWidth(_:inspectorShown:)` / `.windowFrame(forInspectorShown:from:visibleFrame:)` (window 768 closed, 1028 open, 1200 max; the window keeps its width on a toggle, opening only grows it, closing never moves the frame; `MainWindowWidthTests`),
`DockTileConfigurationView.inspectorIsPresented(stored:selection:)` (the inspector shows only for a tile row while the stored flag is on; `InspectorVisibilityTests`),
`DockTileDetailView.heroForcedStyle` / `DockTileConfigurationView.inspectorCommandIsEnabled` (hero is canonical Default/Dark while the inspector is open; ⌥⌘I enabled only for a tile row; `InspectorEntryPointTests`),
`IconFace` tolerant decode + the two defaults (missing key → glyph, new tile → apps; unknown value → glyph; `IconFaceTests`),
`MacOSFloorGuardTests` (the deployment target ↔ appcast floor ↔ macOS 15 CI leg ↔ website requirement claims — read from the files, so the macOS 15 leg cannot be dropped while 15 is supported, and must be once it is not).

Assertion rules: prefer `#require` over `if`-guarded `#expect`; assert exact values/magnitudes,
not `!=nil` / `.isValid` / `a>b`; never write `UserDefaults.standard` in tests — use
`MockUserDefaults`. New files under `DockTileTests/` auto-join the target (synchronized group);
new **app-target** files do not — append to an existing file or edit the pbxproj.

## A guard must be able to fail

Three icon-side guards passed for a *provably broken* implementation: a comparison whose two
sides both collapsed to the same default under the exact regression it targeted; a "no baked
background" check sampling only corners that lay outside the shape anyway; and
`saturation > 0.3`, which the unfixed value already satisfied. Before writing a guard, name the
regression and ask which value would make it fail — if none would, it is decorative, and worse
than nothing because it invites trust.

Prefer a **structural** guarantee wherever one is expressible: deleting a stored property's
default (definite initialisation then forces the seed) or a function parameter's default turns
the regression into a compile error, which no test can beat. State plainly where such a
guarantee stops — definite initialisation catches a naive reorder, not a placeholder-then-real-
assignment restructure.

**A CI check is a guard too, and green is not evidence (2026-10-02).** The first Dock render
check went green while its measurement was INCONCLUSIVE: the measurer could not separate the
icons and exited 0. A check that cannot measure must exit non-zero, and its verdict is read from
what it measured (`measure.txt`), never from the job colour. Same family: an expectation computed
from the thing under test (`== IconPipeline.isDeclarative`) cannot catch that thing regressing —
keep one independent pin beside it. And a check script's argument parsing is part of the guard:
a missing or malformed value must be a usage error, never a silently skipped check
(`dock-measure.swift --expect-apps abc` passed, exit 0, until it was made to exit 2).

## Test-host guard (don't mutate live dev data)

`DockTileTests` is **hosted by the dev app** (`TEST_HOST = Dock Tile Dev.app`), so `xcodebuild test`
launches the real app, whose normal launch path runs against the user's **live dev** support folder,
config, and Dock plist. `AppEnvironment.isRunningTests` (env `XCTestConfigurationFilePath` /
`XCTestCase` present) gates every launch-time mutator on `!isRunningTests`: `configureAsMainApp`
(Dock Lock, login items, Smart Add, relocation), the `DockTileApp` `.task` (helper
migration/regeneration + missing-app scan — migration once corrupted a tile mid-generation),
`ConfigurationManager` init (Dock reconcile + watch), and `main.swift` diagnostics-log trim.
`TestEnvironmentTests` asserts the flag is true so the guard can't silently regress.

## CI

Unit tests run in GitHub Actions (`ci.yml`) on **two hosts**: macos-26, where the project is
built, and macos-15 via `test-without-building` — the only host that runs the legacy icon path
(see [CI & Release](ci-release.md)). So a test must not assume its host: no expectation
hard-coded to the macOS 26 pipeline (follow `IconPipeline.isDeclarative`, or `#available`-gate
the test), and a test that reads the source tree through `#filePath` works on macOS 15 only
because that job checks the repo out at the same path. The first macOS 15 run failed 11 tests for
exactly these two reasons. Since the String Catalog ships (2026-10-17), runtime `AppStrings` values
also follow the test host's language: pin locale-specific expectations through the catalog JSON,
never through `AppStrings` at runtime. Likewise the owner's Mac **icon style**: a test that reads a
real app's icon through `NSWorkspace` gets the CURRENT style, so `AppsFacePreviewTests`
(`oneAppOnLightGlass`, `clearAndTintedDesaturate`, Finder saturation) fail whenever the host is on
Clear or Tinted (2026-10-19). Run the suite on Default, or pin a style with `AppIconStyleRenderer`.
UI/integration tests run locally only.

**Count tests per suite, not by grepping a whole log.** `grep -c "passed"` over an `xcodebuild`
log drifted between runs of the same tree (748/750/765 for one branch), so a "+N tests" claim
built on it cannot be checked. Report `-only-testing:` per-suite executed counts and the
`TEST SUCCEEDED`/`FAILED` line. `DockPlistWatcherReplaceTests.survivesAtomicReplace` still flaked
on macos-26 CI after `81507dd` (2.2.0 main push, passed on re-run) — re-run before suspecting the
change under test.
